# Batch-Installer
A basic python batch installer program with multithreading


## What is this?
This is a basic batch program installer with multithreading, where this program will get a bunch of files from the .json file provided by the user. Which should follow the provided cross.json format as that is what works. This program also requires my personal common library UPL to either be in the file directory or in the python directory.
